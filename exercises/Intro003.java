// In addition, all Java programs should have a designated entry point. Java programs are run
// within a special application called the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This JVM runs as an
// application under the purview of the OS and can execute Java code. When a Java program is
// executed by the JVM, the JVM looks for the signature method
//    `public static void main(String[] args)`
// and calls it. Since this is the first method called by the JVM, it is our "entry point". Java
// programs don't require an entry point, but without one, your application won't do anything when
// executed. This is common for Java libraries but incorrect for tools and applications.
//
// The following Java code won't compile. Fix this program's errors so that it can print a classic
// greeting to the world.
// Execute `javalings hint Intro003` or use the `hint` watch-subcommand for a hint.

// TODO: I AM NOT DONE
