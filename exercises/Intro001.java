// Intro001.java
// In these exercises, we're going to learn/refresh a wide range of Java concepts from the most
// basic to some of the most advanced. Please take time to review each lesson to ensure that you
// "know" how to complete the exercise without the assistance of LSP or IDE tools.
//
// At the top of each file, you'll find a `I AM NOT DONE`. When you are finished completing
// and reviewing the exercise, delete this comment. After the exercise has been successfully
// completed and this comment has been deleted, you may move on to the next exercise.
//
// Execute `javalings hint Intro001` or use the `hint` watch-subcommand for a hint. If you're
// running this using `javalings watch`: The exercise file will be reloaded when you change one of
// the lines below! Try adding a `System.out.println` line, or try changing what it outputs in your
// terminal. Try removing a semicolon and see what happens!
