// As you may know, Java is one of the few legacy programming languages still in popular demand
// today. It was first released in 1995, and, at the time of this exercise, was one of the top
// five most desired programming languages alongside Python3, SQL, JavaScript, and C/C++.
// 
// What distinguishes Java from other programming languages is its commitment to the Object
// Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm. Languages with a similar focus would include Smalltalk,
// Eiffel, Scala, Ruby, and Crystal. Some of the other most desired programming languages 
// mentioned earlier (Python3, JavaScript, C++) permit OOP but are designed around procedural
// programming. Many more modern languages, such as Rust, Go, TypeScript, Julia, Kotlin, Dart, and
// OCaml take a similar approach. You might hear these languages referred to as "general purpose"
// or "multi-paradigmatic" languages. Generally speaking (pun intended) these languages are "better"
// for programming since they permit developers to employ tools from many different programming
// paradigms. The choice of whether to choose a more specialized language or a more general
// language is much like the difference between choosing to be an expert in one field versus
// knowledgeable in several fields. There are advantages and disadvantages to both, and the
// weighing of those is heavily dependent on one's situation and goals.
//
// As it stands, OOP is currently the most widely used programming paradigm and, despite current
// sentiment against OOP, it is still very useful for developers to understand this paradigm well.
// Java remains one of the more useful languages to learn the OOP paradigm and even if you don't
// intend to program in Java later on, you should still make an intentional effort to learn how you
// might make better use of the OOP paradigm in your future projects.
//
// Even though Java remains a great language for teaching OOP, I feel obligated to stress that
// OOP in Java is still done the "Java way". As we work through these exercises, you should try to
// be conscientious of those aspects of the language that relate to the OOP paradigm and those
// aspects that are just Java. To that end, I've included this long ramble at the beginning of
// our first real Javalings exercise to not only teach you something about Java but also to help
// you experience one of Java's first and most notable aspects: it's verbosity and boilerplate.
//
// To begin, all Java **files** must contain a single public outer class designated by the
// keywords `public class` that shares the same name as the file itself. For example, the first
// exercise `Intro001.java` contained the outer class `public class Intro001`.
//
// The following Java code won't compile. Fix this program's errors so that it can print a classic
// greeting to the world.
// Execute `javalings hint Intro002` or use the `hint` watch-subcommand for a hint.
